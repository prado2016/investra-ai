# Email-Based Transaction Import Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement an automated transaction import system that processes Wealthsimple email confirmations to automatically register transactions in the Investra AI portfolio management application.

## Background
Users receive email confirmations from Wealthsimple for every transaction (see reference email example). Currently, users must manually enter each transaction into the app. This feature will automate the process by:
1. Receiving forwarded emails from Wealthsimple
2. Parsing transaction details from email content
3. Automatically creating transactions in the appropriate portfolio
4. Providing alerts for failed imports
