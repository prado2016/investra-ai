# AI Search Feature Reset Fix

## Issue
The AI search feature in the transaction page symbol input would stop working after adding a transaction, requiring a browser refresh to function again.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by stale state in the `EnhancedSymbolInput` component that wasn't being properly reset when the form was submitted. Specifically:

1. **Async operations** - AI processing and validation were running asynchronously and could update state even after the form was reset
2. **Incomplete state reset** - Not all state variables were being cleared during reset
3. **Missing cleanup flags** - No mechanism to prevent stale async operations from updating state

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced State Reset Mechanism
- Added `isCleanedUpRef` flag to prevent async operations from updating state after reset
- Expanded `resetInternalState()` to clear all AI-related state variables:
  - `isAIProcessing`
  - `processedResult` 
  - `lastProcessedQuery`
  - `validationStatus`
  - `errorMessage`
  - `suggestion`
  - `showSuggestionsList`
  - `highlightedIndex`
  - `isFocused`

### 2. Async Operation Protection
- Updated AI processing effect to check `isCleanedUpRef.current` before state updates
- Updated validation effect to respect cleanup flag
- Prevents race conditions between reset and ongoing async operations

### 3. Form Reset Improvements
- Added `getFreshInitialValues()` helper for clean form state
- Improved form reset to use fresh initial values instead of just clearing
- Better coordination between symbol input reset and form reset

## Files Modified

### `/src/components/EnhancedSymbolInput.tsx`
- Added cleanup flag mechanism
- Enhanced reset function to clear all state
- Protected async operations from stale updates

### `/src/components/TransactionForm.tsx`
- Added fresh initial values helper
- Improved form reset coordination
- Better symbol input reset timing

## Testing
Run the test script: `node ai-search-reset-test.js`

## Expected Behavior
- AI search works immediately after each transaction submission
- No browser refresh required between uses
- Complete state cleanup after form submission
- Seamless user experience with symbol input
