## 📋 TASKMASTER-AI ACTION PLAN

The remaining work has been organized into 6 structured tasks using TaskMaster-AI:

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (High Priority)**

**🔥 Next Task: #11 - Complete IMAP Service Deployment**
- Deploy imapProcessorService to production server
- Test connection to email server
- Implement service monitoring and auto-restart
- Configure error handling and logging
- **Command:** `task-master set-status --id=11 --status=in-progress`

**Task #12 - Email Server Production Setup**
- Deploy docker-mailserver to production environment
- Configure DNS records for email delivery
- Set up SSL certificates and security measures
- Create and test transactions@investra.com account

**Task #13 - API Server Production Deployment**
- Deploy Express.js server to production
- Configure environment variables and secrets
- Set up process management and reverse proxy
- Test all API endpoints in production

### **INTEGRATION & TESTING (Medium Priority)**

**Task #14 - End-to-End Integration Testing**
- Test complete email flow: reception → parsing → database
- Validate duplicate detection with real email scenarios
- Test manual review queue workflow
- Performance testing under load

**Task #15 - Monitoring & Alerting Setup**
- Set up email processing monitoring
- Configure alerts for failed imports
- Implement log aggregation and dashboards
- Set up backup and recovery procedures

### **GO-LIVE (Low Priority)**

**Task #16 - Production Validation & Go-Live**
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Create production documentation
- Train users on email management interface
- Gradual rollout with monitoring

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Completed:** 10 major tasks (email processing, UI, database, API design)
- 🔄 **In Progress:** 0 tasks
- ⏳ **Pending:** 6 tasks (infrastructure deployment & testing)
- 🚫 **Blocked:** 0 tasks

**Dependency Chain:**
- Tasks 11, 12, 13 can be worked on in parallel (no dependencies)
- Task 14 depends on completion of tasks 11, 12, 13
- Task 15 depends on completion of task 13
- Task 16 depends on completion of tasks 14, 15

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] IMAP service successfully deployed and connected
- [ ] Email server receiving emails at transactions@investra.com
- [ ] API server responding to all endpoints in production
- [ ] All services monitored and auto-restarting

### **Phase 2: Integration & Testing (Week 2-3)**
- [ ] End-to-end email workflow functioning
- [ ] Duplicate detection validated with real scenarios
- [ ] Performance acceptable under expected load
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational

### **Phase 3: Go-Live (Week 3)**
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation and training completed
- [ ] Gradual rollout successful
- [ ] System stable in production

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Task #11** - `task-master next` shows this as the recommended starting point
2. **Deploy Infrastructure** - Focus on getting the three high-priority deployment tasks completed
3. **Coordinate Parallel Work** - Tasks 11, 12, and 13 can be worked on simultaneously
4. **Test Integration** - Once infrastructure is deployed, focus on end-to-end testing
5. **Monitor Progress** - Use `task-master list` to track progress and dependencies

## 🔍 RISK ASSESSMENT

**Low Risk:**
- Core business logic is complete and tested
- Database schema is production-ready
- Frontend interface is fully functional

**Medium Risk:**
- Infrastructure deployment complexity
- DNS configuration and email delivery
- Service integration and monitoring

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with infrastructure tasks in parallel
- Thorough testing at each integration point
- Gradual rollout with monitoring and rollback capability

---

**Conclusion:** The email import tool is well-positioned for production deployment with solid foundations and clear actionable tasks remaining. The systematic approach using TaskMaster-AI ensures organized completion of the remaining infrastructure work.
