# Production Deployment Guide

## ✅ Production Ready - Email Import System

The email import system has been cleaned up and is ready for production deployment.

## Required Environment Variables

### Critical (Application will not start without these)
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Email Functionality (Optional but recommended)
```bash
IMAP_HOST=your-email-server.com
IMAP_PORT=993
IMAP_SECURE=true
IMAP_USERNAME=transactions@yourdomain.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### API Configuration (Optional)
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
```

## Security Checklist ✅

- ✅ No hardcoded passwords or credentials
- ✅ No hardcoded IP addresses
- ✅ All sensitive data uses environment variables
- ✅ Debug logging disabled in production
- ✅ Mock data removed or properly gated
- ✅ API calls have timeout protection
- ✅ Proper error handling for network failures

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. Hardcoded URLs Removed
- Fixed `localhost:3001` references in EmailConfigurationPanel
- Updated API client to use environment variables with fallbacks
- Added dynamic CORS origin configuration

### 2. Mock Data Removed
- Cleaned test email configurations
- Removed hardcoded IP addresses from server configs
- Gated all remaining mock data with environment flags

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added 30-second timeouts to all API calls
- Proper abort signal handling for fetch requests
- Environment variable validation at startup
- Better error messages for network failures

### 4. Debug Code Cleaned
- Console.log statements gated with development flags
- Production builds exclude debug output
- Error logging preserved for production monitoring

### 5. Production Validation
- Startup validation checks all required environment variables
- API connectivity validation
- Graceful error handling for missing configuration
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
   export VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
   # ... other variables
   ```

2. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Validate Configuration**
   The app will automatically validate configuration on startup and display errors if any are found.

4. **Deploy**
   Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting provider.

## Troubleshooting

### App Shows Configuration Error
- Check browser console for specific missing environment variables
- Ensure all required variables are set correctly

### Email Import Not Working
- Verify IMAP credentials are correct
- Check network connectivity to email server
- Review server logs for detailed error messages

### API Calls Timing Out
- Check `VITE_API_BASE_URL` configuration
- Verify API server is running and accessible
- Check firewall and network settings

## Production Monitoring

The system now includes proper error logging for:
- IMAP connection failures
- Email processing errors
- API connectivity issues
- Database operation failures

All errors are logged to the console with structured error information for monitoring systems.
