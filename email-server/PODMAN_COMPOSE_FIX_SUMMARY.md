# Podman Compose Compatibility Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:
```
Error: executing /usr/local/bin/docker-compose pull: fork/exec /usr/local/bin/docker-compose: exec format error
Error: Process completed with exit code 125.
```

This error occurs when Podman tries to use an external Docker Compose binary that has incompatible architecture or format.

## Root Cause
- Podman was trying to use `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose` as an external compose provider
- The external docker-compose binary had the wrong format/architecture for the target system
- No fallback mechanism was in place for compose command compatibility

## Solution
Created a comprehensive startup script (`start-mailserver.sh`) that handles multiple compose scenarios and provides robust fallbacks.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Smart Compose Command Detection**
- **podman-compose** (native Python implementation) - preferred
- **docker-compose** (with podman compatibility check)
- **podman compose** (built-in subcommand) - fallback
- **Automatic installation** if none found

#### 2. **Multiple Installation Methods**
```bash
# Tries multiple approaches:
- pip3 install --user podman-compose
- DNF/YUM package manager installation
- APT package manager installation  
- Snap package fallback
```

#### 3. **Environment Setup**
- Configures Podman socket automatically
- Sets proper environment variables for docker-compose compatibility
- Handles user permissions and systemd services

#### 4. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Fallback to manual image pulling if compose pull fails
- Continues deployment even if some steps fail
- Clear error messages and troubleshooting hints

#### 5. **Automated Mode for CI/CD**
- Non-interactive mode for GitHub Actions
- Auto-generates missing configurations
- Comprehensive logging and status reporting

### Files Modified

#### 1. **Created `/email-server/start-mailserver.sh`**
Comprehensive startup script with:
- Compose command detection and installation
- Environment setup and configuration
- SSL certificate verification
- Container lifecycle management
- Connectivity testing
- Status monitoring

#### 2. **Updated `/.github/workflows/deploy-email-server.yml`**
```yaml
- name: Start email server
  run: |
    cd ~/investra-email-server
    chmod +x start-mailserver.sh
    EMAIL_PASSWORD="..." \
    HOSTNAME="..." \
    EMAIL_DOMAIN="..." \
    EMAIL_USER="..." \
    ./start-mailserver.sh auto
```

#### 3. **Created Test Scripts**
- `test-podman-compose-fix.sh` - Tests the compatibility fixes
- Enhanced error detection and reporting

### Compatibility Matrix

| System | Primary Method | Fallback 1 | Fallback 2 |
|--------|---------------|------------|------------|
| RHEL/CentOS | podman-compose (pip) | podman compose | docker-compose |
| Ubuntu/Debian | podman-compose (pip) | podman compose | docker-compose |
| Fedora | podman-compose (dnf) | podman compose | docker-compose |

### Error Handling Improvements

#### Before:
```bash
podman compose pull  # Failed with exec format error
podman compose up -d # Never reached
```

#### After:
```bash
# 1. Detect best compose command
# 2. Setup environment properly  
# 3. Try compose pull, fallback to manual pull
# 4. Start containers with proper error handling
# 5. Verify and test connectivity
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Robust Compatibility** - Works across different Podman/Docker Compose versions
2. **Auto-Recovery** - Automatically installs missing dependencies
3. **Clear Diagnostics** - Detailed logging and error reporting
4. **CI/CD Ready** - Designed for automated environments
5. **Manual Fallbacks** - Always provides alternative approaches

### Expected Results

✅ **GitHub Actions should now:**
- Detect and use the best available compose command
- Install podman-compose if needed
- Start the email server successfully
- Provide clear status and connectivity reports

✅ **Manual usage:**
- `./start-mailserver.sh` - Interactive mode
- `./start-mailserver.sh auto` - Automated mode  
- `./start-mailserver.sh test` - Connectivity test only
- `./start-mailserver.sh stop` - Stop containers

### Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes work:
```bash
cd ~/investra-ai/email-server
./test-podman-compose-fix.sh
```

### Next Steps

1. **Push changes** to trigger new GitHub Actions run
2. **Monitor logs** for "Detecting available compose command" messages
3. **Verify connectivity** tests pass
4. **Check container status** in workflow output

The email server deployment should now be much more reliable across different Podman/Docker environments!
