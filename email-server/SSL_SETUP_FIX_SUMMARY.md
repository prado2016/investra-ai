# GitHub Actions SSL Setup Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the email server was failing when trying to install `epel-release` and `certbot` packages on RHEL/CentOS systems with the error:
```
No match for argument: epel-release
No match for argument: certbot
Error: Unable to find a match: epel-release certbot
```

## Root Cause
The workflow was using hardcoded package installation commands that don't work reliably across different RHEL/CentOS versions and configurations.

## Solution
Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to use the improved `setup-ssl.sh` script instead of inline SSL setup commands.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`/.github/workflows/deploy-email-server.yml`)
- **Before**: Used hardcoded `sudo dnf install -y epel-release certbot` commands
- **After**: Uses the comprehensive `setup-ssl.sh` script in automated mode
- **Benefits**: 
  - Handles multiple Linux distributions
  - Graceful fallback to self-signed certificates if Let's Encrypt fails
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Automatic detection of package managers

#### 2. Enhanced SSL Setup Script (`/email-server/setup-ssl.sh`)
- **Improved RHEL/CentOS support**: Multiple fallback methods for EPEL installation
- **Added Snap support**: Alternative certbot installation via snapd if DNF fails
- **Enhanced OpenSSL detection**: Automatic installation of OpenSSL for self-signed certificates
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks instead of hard failures

#### 3. Added Verification Step
- New workflow step to verify SSL certificates are properly generated
- Shows certificate details for debugging
- Fails clearly if certificates are missing

### Key Improvements

1. **Multi-Distribution Support**
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get`
   - RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/AlmaLinux: `dnf`/`yum` with EPEL
   - Fedora: `dnf`
   - Arch/Manjaro: `pacman`
   - openSUSE: `zypper`

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - EPEL repository installation with multiple methods
   - Snap package manager as alternative
   - Self-signed certificates if Let's Encrypt fails
   - Direct EPEL RPM download if repository methods fail

3. **Automated Mode**
   - Designed for CI/CD environments
   - No interactive prompts
   - Clear logging and error messages
   - Graceful degradation

### Testing
Created `test-ssl-setup.sh` to verify the SSL setup works in isolation before deployment.

### Expected Results
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow should complete successfully
- ✅ SSL certificates will be generated (Let's Encrypt preferred, self-signed fallback)
- ✅ Email server deployment continues even if Let's Encrypt fails
- ✅ Clear logging shows which certificate type was used

### Next Steps
1. Push the updated workflow to trigger a new deployment
2. Monitor the "Setup SSL certificates" step in the GitHub Actions logs
3. Verify the email server starts with proper SSL configuration

## Files Modified
1. `/.github/workflows/deploy-email-server.yml` - Updated SSL setup step
2. `/email-server/setup-ssl.sh` - Enhanced RHEL support and error handling
3. `/email-server/test-ssl-setup.sh` - Added test script (new file)

The deployment should now work reliably across different RHEL/CentOS environments!
